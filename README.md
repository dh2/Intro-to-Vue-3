#Purpose
Haven't had a lot of reason to learn other frameworks outside of React.  So taking some time to learn Vue and kicked off with as simple a tutorial as I could find.

#Tweaks
* I added a third image/variety of Sock
* Started keeping in the code challenges around lesson 6?
* Remove from cart is contingent on the variant being in the cart already
* Submitting a review is managed by disabling the button with a computed value instead of an alert with an exit
* Stylized the review portion a bit to use a star (added subsequent styling)
